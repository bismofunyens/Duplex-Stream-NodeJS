# Duplex Stream NodeJS Challenge

This challenge was to show how we would build and use Duplex streams in NodeJS. This application will read from a file called "file.txt" (contains lorem ipsum text)
and calculate the following:
  - Time Elapsed (ms)
  - Number of Lines
  - Length in Bytes
  - Throughput Rate

Once calculated, it will input all the raw data into a an object called "output". The object will then be written to a Writable Stream where it will output a summary report into a file called "report.txt".
## Running the tests

node . (runs the default index.js file)

OR

node index.js

## Running process.argv

- cat file.txt | node . -w (this option will calculate and display the number of words in the file)
- cat file.txt | node . -c (this option will calculate the number of characters in the file)

## Built With

* NodeJS
